    # when retrieving word vectors, this will decide if the casing
    # of the word is relevant. E.g. `hello` and `Hello` will
    # retrieve the same vector, if set to `False`. For some
    # applications and models it makes sense to differentiate
    # between these two words, therefore setting this to `True`.
